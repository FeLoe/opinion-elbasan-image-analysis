# Instructions 
Go to https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive and make a folder titled "images-as-data-workshop-elbasan". Download the materials in this Github repository and upload them into this folder. This is important to have all the links in the notebook (for reading in data) work out of the box. If you decide to store the materials somewhere else you will have to change the links in the notebook. 

At the beginning of the notebook some libraries will have to be installed (cells with !pip), you will have to do this every time you start a new session and it takes a few minutes to run, so make sure to start the code on time. 

Most of the code should run on the free tier of Colab, but especially for the more advanced (multimodal) models at the end it is possible you run out of free hours. You can then decide to just follow along without running any more code yourself.
